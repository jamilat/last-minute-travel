# Last-minute-travels
## Project Description
A web application created for the SFU Fall Hack 2022 with 'At the last minute' as the hackathon theme. The application prompts the user for a city, a selection of available activities in that city, and outputs what the user should pack at the last minute.

We majorly used REACT and Python to build our web applications and gathered/built datasets for cities, actvities and items from multiple sources.
